## Prerequisites

To start up TabPy Server from an environment the following prerequisites are required:

- Python 3.6.5
- setuptools (Python module, can be installed from PyPi)

First, select a TabPy version and download its source code from the
[releases page](https://github.com/tableau/TabPy/releases). To start up
a TabPy server instance, follow the instructions for your OS (found below).

Instructions on how to configure your TabPy server instance can be found in the [TabPy Server Configuration Instructions](server-config.md)

It is highly recommended to use Python virtual enviroment for running TabPy,
check [Running TabPy in Python Virtual Environment](tabpy-virtualenv.md) page
for more details.
If you are installing a new version of TabPy in the same environment as a
previous install, delete the previous TabPy version folder in your Python directory.

## Windows

1. Open a command prompt.
2. Navigate to the folder in which you downloaded your source code.
    - This folder should contain the file: ```startup.cmd```
3. Run the following command from the command prompt:

    ```batch
    startup.cmd
    ```

### Command Line Arguments

To specify the *config file* with which to configure your server instance, pass it in as a command line argument as follows:

```batch
startup.cmd myconfig.conf
```
Replace ```myconfig.conf``` with the path to your config file relative to ```%TABPY_ROOT%\tabpy-server\tabpy_server\```.

For example, in this case your config file would be located at ```%TABPY_ROOT%\tabpy-server\tabpy_server\myconfig.conf```

## Mac

1. Open a terminal.
2. Navigate to the folder in which you downloaded your source code.
    - This folder should contain the file: ```startup.sh```
3. Run the following command from the terminal:

    ```bash
    ./startup.sh
    ```

### Command Line Arguments

- To specify the *port* on which your server instance listens, set the ```-p``` command line argument as follows:

    ```bash
    ./startup.sh -p 1234
    ```

    Replace ```1234``` with the port of your choice.

- To specify the *config file* with which to configure your server instance, set the ```-c``` command line argument as follows:

    ```bash
    ./startup.sh -c myconfig.conf
    ```
    Replace ```myconfig.conf``` with the path to your config file relative to ```$TABPY_ROOT/tabpy-server/tabpy_server/```.

    For example, in this case your config file would be located at ```$TABPY_ROOT/tabpy-server/tabpy_server/myconfig.conf```.

The following is an example of how you might set both the port and the config:

```bash
./startup.sh -p 1234 -c myconfig.conf
```

## Linux

1. Open a terminal.
2. Navigate to the folder in which you downloaded your source code.
    - This folder should contain the file: ```startup.sh```
3. Run the following command from the terminal:

    ```bash
    sudo ./startup.sh
    ```

### Command Line Arguments

- To specify the *port* on which your server instance listens, set the ```-p``` command line argument as follows:

    ```bash
    sudo ./startup.sh -p 1234

    ```

    Replace ```1234``` with the port of your choice.
- To specify the *config file* with which to configure your server instance, set the ```-c``` command line argument as follows:

    ```bash
    sudo ./startup.sh -c myconfig.conf
    ```
    
    Replace ```myconfig.conf``` with the path to your config file relative to ```$TABPY_ROOT/tabpy-server/tabpy_server/```.

    For example, in this case your config file would be located at ```$TABPY_ROOT/tabpy-server/tabpy_server/myconfig.conf```.

The following is an example of how you might set both the port and the config:

```bash
sudo ./startup.sh -p 1234 -c myconfig.conf
```
